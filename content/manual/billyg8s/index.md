## Overview

**`10hp`**

Billy G8s is a 5 channel gate generator.

### Basic Operation

Send any signal to the channel inputs, the inputs are normalised down (so channels with no input
will receive the input from the channel above).

Use the **Threshold parameter** to set the value above which gates are generated. The default is
`0.1 volts`.

The voltage of the output gates will be the **Level parameter** `+` **Offset parameter**. Setting a
negative Level and a positive Offset will created inverted gates for example.

Each channel has a **Length parameter** which controls the length of the gate generated in samples.
For example, at a sample rate of `44.1 kHz` the default parameter value of `4410 samples` would
generate gates of `100 milliseconds`.

Each channel has a **Slope Length** & **Slope Shape** parameter. These control the edges of the
gate, increasing the slope length will create a pseudo-envelope, that is symmetrical when the gate
length is greater or equal to the slope length.

The length of a gate covers the start slope, but not the end slope. A gate is considered `active`
during the start slope and length only. So the total gate length is equal to the gate length `+` the
slope length.

Each channel has an End Trigger input, when this receives a signal above `0 volts` it will end any
currently active gate being generated by that channel.

If the slope length is greater than the slope length, or the gate is ended early, the start slope
will be truncated, the gate will jump to the level parameter value, then follow the end slope.

When a gate ends, if the input signal remains above the threshold value, a new gate will begin
immediately. Note: with small Slope Lengths, this gap between gates will be inaudible.

The shape of the slope will be linear at `0 volts`, tend towards exponential at `-1 volt` and tend
towards logarithmic at `1 volt`.

The **AND** output will generate a gate when all channels have an active gate, the **OR** output
will generate a gate when at least one channel has an active gate. The **AND** & **OR** output gates
do not have slopes.
