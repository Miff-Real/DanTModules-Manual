developed by [DanT](https://www.youtube.com/@MiffReal).

### Project Status

I develop this plugin in my spare time, unfortunately this means that this manual is a constant
work-in-progress, and will probably never receive the input it deserves.

If you would like to contribute to this manual in any way, please do send me a
[pull-request](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github),
open an issue with your contribution, or get in touch via the Forum or VCV community.

I would love to see anything you create with this plugin, tag your creations with `#dantmodules`!
