# DanTModules v2.2.2 Preview Builds

## Overview

In the run up to the [VCV Rack 2 release](https://community.vcvrack.com/t/rack-development-blog/5864/70?u=dan.tilley) I will be trying my best to get the DanTModules plugin upgraded.

As that work progresses I will post Windows builds here for any prospective users to test (at their own risk blah blah blah...)

### Builds

* [DanTModules-20210927](builds/DanTModules-20210927.zip)
  * **Known Issues**
    * In `Param Behaviour: Follow` mode, the Active Points with no CV input connected, does not update on change without a subsequent user interaction.
