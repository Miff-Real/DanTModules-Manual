## Overview

This [plugin](https://library.vcvrack.com/DanTModules/) contains free modules for VCV Rack 2 developed by [DanT](https://www.dtilley.co.uk).

If you encounter any bugs or issues with this plugin or its modules, please raise an [issue](https://github.com/Miff-Real/DanTModules-Manual/issues) in this GitHub repository, or you can ask about a specific module or issues in the [community forums](https://community.vcvrack.com/c/plugins/6).

I develop this plugin in my spare time, unfortunately this means that this manual is a constant work-in-progress, and will probably never receive the input it deserves. If you would like to contribute to this manual in any way, please do send me a [pull-request](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github), open an [issue](https://github.com/Miff-Real/DanTModules-Manual/issues) with your contribution, or [get in touch via the VCV community forums](https://community.vcvrack.com/u/dan.tilley/summary).

I would love to see anything you create with this plugin, tag your creations with `#dantmodules` & the name of the modules used. On Instagram you can also directly tag me [@dant.synth](https://www.instagram.com/dant.synth/)
