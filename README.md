## Modules

### WAVULIKE

![WAVULIKE](/img/wavulike.png)

WAVULIKE is an oscillator that is based on a waveform generated by 1 to 6 control points.

The components of the module are (top to bottom, left to right):

* Waveform Visualization Screen
* Q control knobs A to F
* Q control inputs A to F
* Point control sliders A to F
* Point control inputs A to F
* Active points selector knob
* Frequency knob
* Active points input
* Output amplitude knob
* Fine tune knob
* Output clipping switch
* End of Cycle output
* Waveform output
* Amplitude input
* Volt per octave input

#### Basic Operation

In the initialized state, the module has 4 active points, `A = 0`, `B = 1`, `C = 0`, `D = -1` and their Q controls are all set to `0`.

As you can see in the Visualization Screen, this generates a triangle waveform, which is output at the default pitch of `C4` at full Amplitude of `+-5` volts.

All the inputs allow CV control of the associated parameter.

The Amplitude control can be used as a built in VCA. The Amplitude value is `+-100%` so this control can be used to invert the output waveform.

#### Q Control

Each active control point has an associated Q control knob and input.

The Q control dictates the path of the waveform to the right of the active control point.

At `0` this is linear. Positive or negative values create quadratic BÃ©zier curves.

#### Single Point Mode

When only point A is active the Frequency, Fine Tune and Q control have no effect.

The Output is a static voltage based on the value of the point A slider multiplied by the Amplitude control.

However, it is still possible to create a waveform output by modulating the value of point A.

#### Output Clipping

Each control point value is clamped to `+-1` volt. The Amplitude control scales the output to `+-5` volts at `100%`, which is typical for audio signals in Eurorack.

However, the Q control can cause the waveform to exceed these values.

The Clip Output switch controls the behavior of the Amplitude control when the waveform exceeds `+-5` volts.

When Clip Output is active, the output is limited to `+-5` volts, when inactive the output may exceed `+-5` volts.

#### End Of Cycle

The EOC output sends a `+10` volt trigger at the end of every waveform cycle.

The cycle length is determined by the sample rate and the frequency.

This output can be used to sync other modules to the output waveform. For example, this can be used as an external trigger for the VCV Scope module to prevent the waveform display from phasing.

#### Avoiding Clicks & Pops

Currently, this module does not implement any processing of the input CV. Because of this, abrupt changes in CV values could potentially cause clicks in the output audio.

The are a few ways to counteract this:

* Only input CV that has smooth modulation
* Use a Slew Limiter before the CV inputs to smooth out abrupt changes
* Use an envelope with a small amount of attack on either the CV input or the Amplitude, when the CV changes (This might be on a certain clock for example)

I am considering implementing built-in slew for this module to remove the possibility of generating clicks in the output. If you would like to encourage this you can let me know via an [issue](https://github.com/Miff-Real/DanTModules-Manual/issues), via the [VCV Rack Community](https://community.vcvrack.com/t/dantmodules-v1-0-0-release-wavulike/11776), or via my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dant.synth/)
